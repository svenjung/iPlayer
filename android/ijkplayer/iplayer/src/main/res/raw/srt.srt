是坦格利安家族建造了这座城堡
and the Targaryens built this castle.

60
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,970
是的  是他们建的

统领着三河流域
Well, it's no good being Lord of the Riverlands

71

好酒不能浪费在娘们身上

我承认  但我为你们骄傲

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,540
这是个错误
No, no, that was your mistake.

97
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,850
你们应该斩草除根  一个不留

等有人问起发生了什么

123
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,450
所有十到六十岁间的人
Everyone aged 10 to 60

124
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,050
要每天用矛  枪  弓和箭练武
will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.

125
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,370
也该教教夏天生的男孩怎么打仗了
It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.

126
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,490
不仅是男孩
Not just the boys.

127
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,810
我们若想保卫北境
We can't defend the North

128
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,300
就不能只靠一半人口去打仗
if only half the population is fighting.

129
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,210
你要我让孙女手拿长矛吗
You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?

130
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,700
男人为我打仗时  我可不打算在火边做针线
I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me.

131
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,670
我虽小  葛洛佛大人  我虽是个女孩
I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl,

132
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,320
但我跟你一样是北境人
but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.

133
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,680
是的  小姐  没人质疑...
Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--

134
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,210
我保卫北境  不需要你允许
And I don't need your permission to defend the North.

135
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,460
我们会开始训练
We'll begin training every man,

136
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,650
熊岛的每一个男女老幼
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

137
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,000
说得好
Aye!

138
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,220
准备抵御强敌的同时
While we're preparing for attack,

139
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,910
我们还需要加固防御
we need to shore up our defenses.

140
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,820
我们和死人军团之间
The only thing standing

141
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,200
唯有一座绝境长城
between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

142
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,430
而长城几百年来一直驻守人数不足
and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries.

143
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,500
我不是自由民的国王
I'm not the king of the Free Folk.

144
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,610
但如果我们想一起熬过这个冬天...
But if we're going to survive this winter together...

145
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,640
你要我们为你驻守要塞
You want us to man the castles for you?

146
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,920
没错
Aye.

147
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,910
我们上次见到夜王是在艰难屯
Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome.

148
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,260
距艰难屯最近的要塞是东海望
The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

149
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,090
那我就去那里
Then that's where I'll go.

150
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,930
看来我们成了守夜人了
Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.

151
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,820
如果他们突破长城
If they breach the Wall,

152
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,510
首当其冲的两座城堡
the first two castles in their path

153
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,880
是最后壁炉城和卡霍城
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

154
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,280
安柏家和卡史塔克家背叛了北境
The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North.

155
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,310
他们的城堡该被夷为平地
Their castles should be torn down

156
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,120
一块石头也不留
with not a stone left standing.

157
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,640
城堡又未犯罪
The castles committed no crimes.

158
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,150
要迎接大战  我们需要每一座堡垒
And we need every fortress we have for the war to come.

159
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,380
最后壁炉城和卡霍城应该分给新的家族
We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families,

160
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,270
支持过我们对抗拉姆斯的家族
loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.

161
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,060
对
Aye!

162
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,620
安柏家和卡史塔克家
The Umbers and the Karstarks

163
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,990
跟史塔克家并肩战斗了数百年
have fought beside the Starks for centuries.

164
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,550
世代忠心耿耿
They've kept faith for generation after generation.

165
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,120
但他们背弃了誓言
And then they broke faith.

166
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,100
我不会为几个不肖子孙所犯之罪
I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes

167
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,590
将这些家族逐出祖居的城堡
because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.

168
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,330
那么叛者不罚
So there's no punishment for treason

169
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,340
忠者无赏吗
and no reward for loyalty?

170
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,220
背叛的惩罚是死亡
The punishment for treason is death.

171
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,620
小琼恩·安柏死在战场上
Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle.

172
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,410
哈拉德·卡史塔克死在战场上
Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.

173
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,780
他们是为拉姆斯效命战死
They died fighting for Ramsay.

174
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,380
将城堡赏给
Give the castles to the families

175
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,980
为你效命战死之人的家族
of the men who died fighting for you.

176
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,930
我担任守夜人军团总司令的时候
When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch...

177
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,710
处死过背叛我的人
I executed men who betrayed me.

178
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,540
处死过抗命不遵的人
I executed men who refused to follow orders.

179
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,620
我父亲过去常说
My father always said,

180
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,360
"判人死刑者必须亲自动手"
"The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"

181
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,090
我也一直遵循他的教诲
and I have tried to live by those words.

182
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,020
但我不会为父亲的罪过责罚儿子
But I will not punish a son for his father's sins,

183
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,270
我也不会剥夺一个家族
and I will not take a family home

184
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,600
经营了数百年的家园
away from a family it has belonged to for centuries.

185
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,880
这就是我的决定
That is my decision,

186
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,780
最终决定
and my decision is final.

187
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
奈德·安柏
Ned Umber.

188
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,930
亚丽·卡史塔克
Alys Karstark.

189
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,560
几百年来  我们的家族
For centuries, our families fought

190
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,610
在战场上并肩战斗
side by side on the battlefield.

191
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,880
我请求你们再次对史塔克家宣誓效忠
I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark,

192
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,510
做我们家族的封臣
to serve as our bannermen

193
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,020
听凭调遣  有求必应
and come to our aid whenever called upon.

194
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,470
请起
Stand.

195
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,630
昨日的战争已不再重要
Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore.

196
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,700
北境必须团结一心
The North needs to band together,

197
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,030
每一个活着的北境人
all the living north.

198
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,530
你们会站在我身边吗  奈德  亚丽
Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys,

199
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,380
从今开始  直到永远
now and always?

200
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,650
从今开始  直到永远
Now and always!

201
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,300
你是我妹妹  但我现在是国王
You are my sister, but I am king now.

202
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,850
你会开始戴王冠吗
Will you start wearing a crown?

203
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,200
你在那些领主和夫人面前
When you question my decisions

204
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,670
质疑我的决定  会有损我的威信
in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.

205
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,540
我都不能质疑你的决定了吗
So I can't question your decisions anymore?

206
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,460
你当然可以  但是...
Of course you can, but--

207
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,550
乔佛里从不允许任何人质疑他的权威
Joffrey never let anyone question his authority.

208
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,200
你认为他是个好国王吗
You think he was a good king?

209
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,180
你认为我是乔佛里吗
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

210
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,800
你跟乔佛里完全不同
You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.

211
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,030
谢谢
Thank you.

212
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,880
你很擅长这种事
You're good at this, you know.

213
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,920
-擅长什么  -统治
- At what? - At ruling.

214
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,300
才怪
No.

215
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,230
是真的
You are.

216
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,030
真的
You are.

217
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,540
他们尊重你  真的尊重你
They respect you, they really do,

218
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,710
但是你必须...
but you have to

219
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,070
你笑什么
Why are you laughing?

220
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,340
父亲过去怎么说的
What did father used to say?

221
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,410
"但是"才是重点  前面都是狗屁
Everything before the word "But" is horse shit.

222
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,110
他从没对我说过这话
He never said that to me.

223
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,010
当然没有  他从不在女儿面前说粗话
No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.

224
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,100
因为他想保护我们
Because he was trying to protect us.

225
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,960
他从不想让我们看到这世界有多肮脏
He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is,

226
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,890
但是父亲保护不了我  你也不能
but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you.

227
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,360
-别总想着保护我  -好  我不会了
- Stop trying. - All right, I'll stop trying to protect you

228
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,750
你也不要再破坏我的威信
and you stop trying to undermine me.

229
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,610
我没有破坏你的威信
I'm not trying to undermine you!

230
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,120
你必须比父亲精明
You have to be smarter than Father.

231
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,540
你需要比罗柏精明
You need to be smarter than Robb.

232
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,910
我爱他们  我想念他们
I loved them, I miss them,

233
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,220
但是他们犯了愚蠢的错误
but they made stupid mistakes,

234
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,340
害得他们掉了脑袋
and they both lost their heads for it.

235
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,100
我怎么才能更精明
And how should I be smarter?

236
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,960
听你的话吗
By listening to you?

237
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,580
听我的话有这么可怕吗
Would that be so terrible?

238
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,370
君临来的信鸦  陛下
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

239
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,390
"兰尼斯特家族的瑟曦一世
"Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name,

240
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,440
安达尔人和先民的女王
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

241
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,920
七国守护..."
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"

242
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,160
她要怎样
What does she want?

243
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,000
前往君临
Come to King's Landing.

244
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,610
屈膝认罪  不然就接受叛徒的命运
Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.

245
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,420
你太过专注北方的敌人
You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north,

246
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,400
忘记了南方的威胁
you've forgotten about the one to the south.

247
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
我专注对付夜王是因为我见过他
I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him.

248
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,580
相信我  你若也见过  就不会考虑别的
And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.

249
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,510
面对夜王  我们还有长城可守
We still have a wall between us and the Night King.

250
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,440
我们与瑟曦之间毫无阻隔
There's nothing between us and Cersei.

251
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,130
我们跟瑟曦相隔数千里之遥
There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei.

252
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,030
凛冬已至  兰尼斯特的手下是南方军队
Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army.

253
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,890
他们的势力从未触及这么北的地方
They've never ranged this far north.

254
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,380
你懂军事  但是我了解她
You're the military man, but I know her.

255
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,330
对敌人  她不毁灭绝不罢休
If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you.

256
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,660
每一个惹过她的人  都被她设法除掉了
Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.

257
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,650
听起来你好像很佩服她
You almost sound as if you admire her.

258
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,250
我从她身上学到很多
I learned a great deal from her.

259
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,330
这是什么
What is this?

260
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,440
这是我们一生的期待
It's what we've been waiting for our whole lives.

261
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,240
这就是父亲训练我们的目的  不管他是否知道
It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.

262
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,290
他知道
He knew it.

263
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,740
逼我记住每一个该死的城镇
Made me memorize every damn city, town,

264
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,360
湖泊  森林与山脉
lake, forest, and mountain.

265
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,740
现在都是我们的了  我们只消伸手去拿
It's ours now. We just have to take it.

266
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,190
你自从回来后就不大说话
You've been quiet since you came home.

267
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,780
你在生我的气吗
Are you angry with me?

268
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,770
不  没有生气
No, not angry.

269
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,460
你害怕我吗
Are you afraid of me?

270
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,550
我应该怕你吗
Should I be?

271
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,670
丹妮莉丝·坦格利安任命提利昂为首相
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand.

272
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,810
此时此刻  他们正在渡过狭海
Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea,

273
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,470
志在夺回她父亲的王座
hoping to take back her father's throne.

274
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,170
我们的弟弟
Our little brother,

275
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,490
那个你最爱的弟弟
the one you love so much,

276
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,800
那个你放走的弟弟
the one you set free,

277
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,270
那个杀死父亲  杀死我们长子的弟弟
the one who murdered our father and our first-born son,

278
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,930
正在我们的敌人身旁  为之出谋划策
now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel.

279
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,290
他带着一支强大的舰队
He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada.

280
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,280
他们会在哪里登陆
Where will they land?

281
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,510
龙石岛
Dragonstone.

282
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,310
那里有可供舰队停泊的深水港
They have deep-water ports for the ships.

283
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,260
史坦尼斯走后城堡无人占领
Stannis left the castle unoccupied,

284
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,830
而且那里还是她出生之地
and that's where she was born.

285
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,020
东边的敌人
Enemies to the east.

286
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,770
南边的敌人
Enemies to the south--

287
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,580
艾拉莉亚·沙德和她的那群小婊子
Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

288
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,580
{\an8}多恩海

289
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,110
西边的敌人
Enemies to the west--

290
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,470
奥莲娜  那个老贱人
Olenna, the old cunt.

291
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,650
另一个叛徒
Another traitor.

292
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,650
{\an8}高庭

293
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,580
北边的敌人
Enemies to the north.

294
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,490
奈德·史塔克的私生子当上了北境之王
Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North

295
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,890
还有那个杀人的婊子珊莎在他身边
and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him.

296
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,720
到处都是敌人  我们被叛徒包围了
Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors.

297
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,220
你现在掌管着兰尼斯特的军队
You're in command of the Lannister army now.

298
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,640
-我们该如何进军  -凛冬已至
- How do we proceed? - Winter is here.

299
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,330
如果我们喂不饱自己的人马就打不赢这场战争
We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses.

300
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,800
提利尔家手里有粮食和牲畜
The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.

301
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,020
提利尔家的封臣会与
Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside

302
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,290
多斯拉克部落和奴隶士兵无垢者共事吗
a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?

303
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,600
如果他们认为丹妮莉丝会获胜的话
If they think Daenerys will win.

304
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,110
没人愿意为失败的一方而战
No one wants to fight on the losing side.

305
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,460
现在  我们看起来必败无疑
Right now, we look like the losing side.

306
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,870
我是七国女王
I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

307
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,200
顶多有三国
Three kingdoms, at best.

308
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,410
我不清楚你是否明白我们现在的处境有多危险
I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.

309
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,100
我明白我们正面临生死之战
I understand we're in a war for survival.

310
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,240
我明白败者必死
I understand whoever loses dies.

311
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,050
我明白胜者会建立
I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty

312
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,770
一个延续千秋万代的王朝
that lasts a thousand years.

313
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,500
谁的王朝
A dynasty for whom?

314
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,920
我们的孩子都死了
Our children are dead.

315
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,530
只剩下你我了
We're the last of us.

316
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,370
那就是你我的王朝
A dynasty for us, then.

317
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,240
我们从没谈过托曼的事
We never talked about Tommen.

318
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,590
没什么可谈的
There's nothing to say.

319
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,920
我们的小儿子自杀了
Our baby boy killed himself.

320
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,100
他背叛了我
He betrayed me.

321
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,960
他背叛了我们俩
He betrayed us both.

322
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,700
我们要整天悼念逝去之人吗
Should we spend our days mourning the dead--

323
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,430
母亲  父亲  还有我们所有的孩子
mother, father, and all our children?

324
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,550
-瑟曦  -我爱他们  我爱过
- Cersei-- - I loved them. I did.

325
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,700
但是他们已成灰烬  而你我还活着
But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood.

326
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,930
我们是最后的兰尼斯特  余者都不重要了
We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.

327
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,390
即使是兰尼斯特  没有盟友也无法生存
Even Lannisters can't survive without allies.

328
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,470
我们的盟友在哪里
Where are our allies now?

329
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,030
你看到瓦德·佛雷和他家族的下场了
You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.

330
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,140
我听说了
I heard.

331
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,050
-我们怎能信任那样一个人  -是不能
- How could we ever trust a man like that? - We couldn't.

332
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,860
他是个没用的老懦夫
He was a useless, old coward,

333
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,070
但是佛雷家支持过我们
but the Freys supported us.

334
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,150
现在他们都死了
Now they're all dead.

335
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,790
杀他们的人必定是敌非友
Whoever killed them is no friend of ours.

336
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,490
我们需要盟友
We need allies.

337
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,210
更强大  更有价值的盟友
Stronger, better allies.

338
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,990
我们单枪匹马赢不了这场战争
We can't win this war alone.

339
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,920
你以为我听了父亲四十年的教导
You think I listened to Father for 40 years

340
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,900
什么都没学到吗
and learned nothing?

341
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,600
葛雷乔伊
The Greyjoys?

342
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,170
你邀请葛雷乔伊家来君临
You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?

343
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,550
-不是他们所有人  -可看起来是这样
- Not all of them. - Well, it looks like all of them.

344
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,210
我邀请了攸伦·葛雷乔伊
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

345
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,470
铁群岛的新王
the new King of the Iron Islands.

346
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,040
你自己说的  我们需要更强大更有价值的盟友
You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies.

347
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,780
-就是他们  -他们怎么是更有价值的盟友
- There you are. - How are they better allies?

348
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,100
他们跟佛雷家有什么区别
How are they different from the Freys?

349
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,410
他们同样违背了誓言
They both broke their promises

350
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,270
一旦有利可图便谋害了昔日盟友
and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.

351
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,990
每个人一旦有利可图都会这么做
So does everyone when it suits them.

352
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,730
跟佛雷家不同的是  他们有船
Unlike the Freys, they have ships.

353
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,610
-而且擅长杀戮  -他们一无所长
- And they're good at killing. - They're not good at anything.

354
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,980
我了解铁民  他们身材矮小  暴戾无常
I know the ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people.

355
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,750
他们只懂得劫掠
All they know how to do is

356
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,340
自己造不出和种不活的东西
steal things they can't build or grow themselves.

357
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,140
攸伦·葛雷乔伊不是为劫掠而来
Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.

358
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,090
那他为了什么
Oh, what did he come here for, then?

359
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,870
一位女王
A queen.

360
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,540
我刚被选为铁群岛之王
The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands,

361
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,180
他们就背叛了我
they turned on me.

362
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,340
他们的亲叔叔
Their own uncle.

363
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,510
他们偷了我最好的几艘船  跑了
They stole my best ships and ran.

364
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,200
乘着它们漂洋过海
Sailed them right across the world

365
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
将其献给了龙女王
and gave them to the Dragon Queen

366
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,530
使她得以率军渡海  攻击你们
so she could bring her armies here to attack you.

367
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,480
据我所知  跟您的遭遇比起来
It's nothing compared to the treason you suffered

368
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,080
我那点众叛亲离算不上什么
at the hands of a family member, from what I hear.

369
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,700
但我还是很恼火
But still, it bothers me.

370
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,130
杀了他们能让我好过很多
Murdering them would make me feel a lot better.

371
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,490
而且既然那些背叛我们的家人
And since it appears that all our treasonous family members

372
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,600
现在都是一伙的
are fighting for the same side,

373
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,970
我想我们两位正统的君主
I thought we rightful monarchs

374
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,280
应该联合起来剿灭他们
could murder them together.

375
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,850
你不是什么正统的君主吧
You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?

376
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,050
葛雷乔伊家族曾起兵叛乱
The Greyjoys rebelled against

377
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,590
妄图自立为王
the throne for the right to be monarchs,

378
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,240
但据我所知  你们败得很惨
but as I recall, you were soundly defeated.

379
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,890
说到这个
Come to mention it,

380
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,990
你不就是那个挑起叛乱
weren't you the one who started that rebellion

381
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,630
把船开到凯岩城  烧了兰尼斯特舰队的人吗
by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet?

382
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,050
确实打了我们一个措手不及
You certainly caught us there.

383
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,600
在你而言可谓一步好棋
Very smart move on your part.

384
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,050
当然  我们还是攻克了铁群岛
Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway.

385
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,040
我当时在场
I was there.

386
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,610
我记得很清楚
I remember very well.

387
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,960
我看到你了
I saw you.

388
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,150
我听过很多传言
I heard so much talk.

389
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,460
绝世无双  无人能敌
The best in the world. No one can stop him.

390
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,060
老实说  我先前还不信
I didn't believe it, to be honest.

391
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,230
但我必须承认  当你破墙而入
But I must say when you rushed through the breach

392
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,370
大杀四方...
and started cutting people down...

393
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,900
的确荡人心魄
it was glorious.

394
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
像一场舞蹈
Like a dance.

395
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,430
我杀的可是你的亲族
The people I was cutting down were your own kin.

396
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,970
反正那地方人太多
The place was getting crowded.

397
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,210
我观赏得非常愉快  真的
I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.

398
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,460
我也喜欢杀葛雷乔伊家的人
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

399
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,860
对我来说是好事
A good thing for me.

400
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,450
要不是你击溃我们  我也不会走上逃亡之路
If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile.

401
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,880
我要是不走
If I hadn't done that,

402
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,840
就不会成为十四海之内最强大的船长
I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.

403
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,580
但不是最谦逊的
If not the most humble.

404
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,430
您也不谦逊
You're not humble.

405
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,690
您是广阔国度的女王
You're the queen of a great nation.

406
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,510
您才不稀罕铁群岛
You don't care about the Iron Islands.

407
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,720
那里有的不过是石头  鸟粪...
They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--

408
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,440
和一帮无趣至极的人
and a lot of very unattractive people.

409
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,520
然而铁舰队
The Iron Fleet, on the other hand,

410
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,700
就是另一回事了
that's something else entirely.

411
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,680
它是维斯特洛有史以来最强的舰队
It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen.

412
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,290
有了铁舰队  您就拥有了海洋
With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas.

413
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,920
您可以打败东方的侵略者
You can defeat the invaders of the east

414
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,540
也可铲除南北方的伪王
and the pretenders of the north and south.

415
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,910
条件是什么
What do you want in return?

416
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,710
我还是个小男孩时
Ever since I was a little boy,

417
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,590
就希望长大以后
I wanted to grow up and marry

418
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,990
娶世上最美的女人为妻
the most beautiful woman in the world.

419
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,150
所以我来了
So here I am,

420
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,260
带来一千艘船
with a thousand ships

421
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,660
和我健全的双手
and two good hands.

422
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,830
我拒绝你的求婚
I decline your proposal.

423
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,730
为什么
Why?

424
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,420
你不值得信任
You're not trustworthy.

425
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,170
你曾背弃盟友
You've broken promises to allies before

426
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,670
一有机会就杀了他们
and murdered them at the nearest opportunity.

427
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,350
你还杀了你的亲兄弟
You murdered your own brother.

428
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,030
您也应该试试  感觉好极了
You should try it. Feels wonderful.

429
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,640
我不指望您立刻相信我
I don't expect you to trust me outright.

430
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,200
您需要我自证忠诚可靠
You need proof of my honest intentions.

431
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,560
以我的经验
In my experience,

432
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,420
赢得女人心最好的办法就是送礼物
the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift.

433
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,000
一份无价的礼物
A priceless gift.

434
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,670
不为您拿到那份礼物
I won't return to King's Landing

435
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,440
我决不回君临
until I have that for you.

436
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,590
威兰德学士
Ah, Maester Weyland.

437
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,160
典型的酒鬼肝脏
A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.

438
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,390
称一下
Weigh that.

439
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,040
一时欢愉的胜利
The triumph of transitory pleasures.

440
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,620
人类的诅咒
Mankind's curse.

441
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,650
博士  我在想...
Archmaester, I was wondering...

442
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,060
多重
What's the weight?

443
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,520
147
Um, 147.

444
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,810
不知道您有没有考虑过我的提议
I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.

445
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,950
我不记得你有什么提议
I don't remember your proposition.

446
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,880
我问过您  鉴于我在北境所见
I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North,

447
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,160
能不能允许我进入图书馆的禁区
if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.

448
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,650
禁区是学士们专用的
That area is reserved for maesters.

449
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
-你是学士吗  -不是
- Are you a maester? - No.

450
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
你的提议不太有说服力  不是吗
Not a very strong proposition, is it?

451
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,360
博士  无意冒犯
Archmaester, with respect,

452
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,110
我见过他们
I've seen them...

453
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,740
死人军团
the Army of the Dead.

454
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,920
异鬼
The white walkers.

455
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,010
我是被派来学习怎么打败他们的
I was sent here to learn how to defeat them,

456
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,780
但学城的所有人
but everyone in the Citadel,

457
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,770
起码是愿意和我说话的人
those who will even talk to me,

458
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,270
他们全都质疑异鬼的存在
they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.

459
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,560
学城的所有人质疑所有事情
Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything.

460
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,620
这是他们的本分
It's their job.

461
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,520
但是长夜的故事不可能全是编的
But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication.

462
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,080
互不关联的资料里有太多相似的记载
Too many similarities from unconnected sources.

463
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,720
禁区里的资料吗
Sources in the restricted area?

464
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,930
正是
The very same.

465
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,190
你这么执念于异鬼一事
And the simplest explanation

466
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,970
最简单的解释就是
for your grating obsession with the white walkers

467
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,730
你在说实话
is that you're telling the truth

468
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,470
如你所说  你确实见过
and that you saw what you say you saw.

469
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,710
所以您相信我
So, you believe me.

470
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,660
是的
I do.

471
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,230
你还不去称那颗心脏
You'll finish weighing that heart?

472
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,140
那您就是孪河城以南唯一相信我的人
That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.

473
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,550
我们和孪河城以南的人不一样
We're not like the people south of the Twins.

474
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,660
我们和孪河城以北的人也不一样
And we're not like the people north of the Twins.

475
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,680
在学城  我们为着不同的信仰过着不同的生活
In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons.

476
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,240
我们是世界的记忆  山姆威尔·塔利
We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly.

477
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,940
没有我们  人将与犬类无异
Without us, men would be little better than dogs.

478
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,400
只记得上一顿饭
Don't remember any meal but the last,

479
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,710
只看得见眼前的事
can't see forward to any but the next.

480
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,120
每次你离开屋子关上门
And every time you leave the house and shut the door,

481
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,040
它们都嚎得好像你再也不回来了
they howl like you're gone forever.

482
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,560
劳勃的叛军横扫大地的时候
When Robert's Rebellion was raging,

483
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,030
人们觉得世界末日到了
people thought the end was near.

484
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,150
坦格利安王朝要结束了  "我们要怎么活"
The end of the Targaryen dynasty. "How will we survive?"

485
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,080
当伊耿·坦格利安的目光转向西方
When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward

486
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,400
乘着巨龙飞临黑水河
and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush,

487
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,660
"世界末日来了  我们要怎么活"
"The end is near! How will we survive?"

488
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,350
几千年前  长夜之时
And thousands of years before that, during the Long Night,

489
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,390
人们有理由相信那真的是末日
we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end.

490
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,320
但那不是  全都不是
But it wasn't. None of it was.

491
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,360
长城一直屹立不倒
The Wall has stood through it all.

492
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,630
而每一个冬天都结束了
And every winter that ever came has ended.

493
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,980
乖  收拾干净
Be a good lad. Clean this up.

494
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,400
不行
Nope.

495
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,780
不行
Nope.

496
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,350
你这小子真走运
You're a lucky man.

497
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,660
我听说她单挑打败了猎狗
I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat.

498
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,190
真是个相当厉害的女人
She's a very impressive woman.

499
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,380
你想要什么  贝里席大人
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

500
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
我想要你快乐
I want you to be happy.

501
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,120
我想要你安全
I want you to be safe.

502
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,560
我很安全
I am safe.

503
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,930
我在自己家  有朋友陪伴
I'm at home, surrounded by friends.

504
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,760
我有布蕾妮保护  谁也伤不了我
I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me.

505
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,200
那快乐呢
What about happy?

506
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,840
你为什么不快乐
Why aren't you happy?

507
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,470
你有什么想要却没有的东西
What do you want that you do not have?

508
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,000
此时此刻  安宁和清静
At the moment, peace and quiet.

509
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,170
别费心思总结发言了  贝里席大人
No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish.

510
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,450
我就当你说了句好听的
I'll assume it was something clever.

511
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,460
小姐
My lady.

512
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,050
告辞
My lady.

513
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,230
他为什么还在这里
Why is he still here?

514
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,660
我们需要他的军队
We need his men.

515
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,540
要不是谷地支援
Without the Vale,

516
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,440
这座城堡还被拉姆斯·波顿占领着
Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle.

517
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,620
小指头救了我们
Littlefinger saved us.

518
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,100
他有所欲求
He wants something.

519
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,460
我清楚他的欲求
I know exactly what he wants.

520
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,800
*他奔驰在城里的街道*
*He rode through the streets of the city*

521
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,210
*离开那高高的山岗*
*Down from his hill on high*

522
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,500
*马踏过鹅卵石阶小巷*
*O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles*

523
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,760
*带他到姑娘的身旁*
*He rode to a woman's sigh*

524
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,450
*她是他珍藏的宝贝呀*
*For she was his secret treasure*

525
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,530
*她是他含羞的期望*
*She was his shame and his bliss*

526
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,880
*项链和城堡都是空呀*
*And a chain and a keep are nothing*

527
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,550
*比不上姑娘的吻好*
*Compared to a woman's kiss*

528
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,910
*金手触摸冰冰凉呀*
*For hands of gold are always cold*

529
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,980
*而姑娘小掌热乎乎*
*But a woman's hands are warm*

530
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,520
*金手触摸冰冰凉呀*
*For hands of gold are always cold*

531
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,520
*而姑娘小掌...*
*But a woman's hands are…*

532
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,070
歌很好听
That's a pretty song.

533
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,600
我没听到过
I've never heard it before.

534
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,630
是首新歌
It's a new one.

535
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,230
你饿了吗  我们有兔子肉
Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.

536
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,320
我不想偷你们的食物
I don't want to steal your food.

537
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,160
不是偷  是我们给的
You're not stealing, we're offering.

538
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,820
来吧  今晚会很冷
Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.

539
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,730
你要去南方吗
You heading south?

540
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,050
君临
King's Landing.

541
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,190
可怜的姑娘
Poor girl.

542
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,700
没那么糟吧
Not so bad, is it?

543
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,940
取决于你的喜好
Depends on your taste, I guess.

544
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,020
如果你喜欢街上满是
If you like your streets covered

545
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,600
屎尿和猪血  那很适合你
in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

546
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,340
我一直想见到红堡
All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep,

547
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,630
贝勒大圣堂和龙穴
the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit.

548
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,310
等我终于到了君临
Then when I finally make it,

549
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,290
红堡一里之内不得靠近
they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep,

550
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,450
贝勒大圣堂化为了灰烬
the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell,

551
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,920
而龙穴是一堆七零八落的废墟
and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.

552
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,270
生活在那里的人
The people who live there,

553
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,150
如果能从你身上搞到两个铜板
they'd skin you alive if

554
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,040
他们会活剥了你
they could make two coppers off your hide.

555
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,910
世上最糟糕的地方
Worst place in the world.

556
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,280
你们在河间地做什么
What are you doing in the Riverlands?

557
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,310
孪河城的佛雷家遇到了麻烦
There's been some trouble with the Freys up at the Twins,

558
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,910
我们是被派去维持治安的一部分军队
so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace.

559
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,870
给  客人优先
Here you go. Guests first.

560
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,570
不  不行  你们不够分
Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough.

561
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,100
我母亲一直教导我要对陌生人友好
My mother always told me to be kind to strangers.

562
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,950
陌生人就会对你友好
Strangers will be kind to you.

563
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,320
你们离家很远
You're a long way from home.

564
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,570
我敢说你们也有些传奇经历
I'm sure you've had some adventures, though.

565
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,520
是的  说不完的传奇
Yeah, endless adventures.

566
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,270
我们的故事将会千年传唱
They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.

567
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,890
事实上  我们离家时迫不及待要走
The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away.

568
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,210
如今我们出来了  又迫不及待想回家
But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home.

569
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,240
我只是想着我爸独自一人在船上
I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone.

570
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,140
我应该陪着他的
I ought to be out there with him.

571
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,450
我妻子刚生下我们第一个孩子
My wife just had our first baby.

572
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,700
-男孩还是女孩  -谁知道
- Boy or girl? - Oh, who knows?

573
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,380
你觉得士兵会有信鸦传递家书吗
You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?

574
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,460
-我希望是个女孩  -为什么
- I hope it's a girl. - Why?

575
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,450
女孩会在爸爸年老时照顾他们
Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old.

576
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,090
男孩只会跑出去替人卖命打仗
Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.

577
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,000
你到了喝酒的年纪吗
Are you old enough to drink?

578
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,150
是黑莓酒
It's blackberry wine.

579
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,960
我自己酿的
I made it myself.

580
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,380
很好喝
It's really good.

581
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,290
一个好姑娘孤身一人去君临做什么
So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?

582
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,890
我要去刺杀女王
I'm going to kill the queen.

583
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,670
这天气不适合在外过夜
Bad night to be outdoors.

584
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,230
你可真了不得  竟然能发现这一点
You've got real powerful magic to figure that out.

585
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,470
光之王悄悄告诉你的吗
Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear?

586
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,730
"天在下雪  索罗斯  风很大
"It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy.

587
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,030
今晚会很冷"
It's gonna be a cold night."

588
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,820
你是一头暴躁的老狗熊  不是吗  克里冈
You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane?

589
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,880
要点朗姆酒吗
You want some rum?

590
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,520
不喜欢那玩意儿  太甜了
Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.

591
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,120
你为什么总是一副臭脾气
Why are you always in such a foul mood?

592
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,500
经历使然
Experience.

593
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,560
在这里过夜好像不错
This seems like a good place to spend the night.

594
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,130
这些人不欢迎我们
These people don't want us here.

595
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,120
好像废弃了  没有牲口
Seems deserted to me. No livestock.

596
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,200
烟囱里没冒烟
No smoke coming from the chimney.

597
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,380
我不喜欢这里的样子
I don't like the look of it.

598
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,170
你这么个彪形大汉  太容易被吓到了
For a big, hard man, you scare easy.

599
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,600
我来告诉你什么吓不到我
I'll tell you what doesn't scare me--

600
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,820
你这样的光头傻蛋
bald cocksuckers like you.

601
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,840
你以为那个顶髻能骗得了所有人吗
You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot?

602
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,740
秃头蠢货
Bald cunt.

603
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,500
来吧
Come on.

604
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,350
没准他们藏了一些麦酒
Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.

605
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,850
他们没有
They don't.

606
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,300
看看有没有地窖
See if there's a larder.

607
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,300
他们总是会留下一些东西
They always leave something behind.

608
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,050
你觉得他们是怎么走的
How do you think it ended for them?

609
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,270
死了
With death.

610
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,620
女孩死在父亲的怀里
Girl died in her father's arms.

611
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,030
他们浑身是血  脚边有一把刀
Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet.

612
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,860
我猜他们饿得不行
I'd say they were starving.

613
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,010
他不愿意让小女儿受苦
And rather than let his little girl suffer,

614
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,930
索性结果了两人的性命
he ended it for both of them.

615
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,020
现在不重要了
Doesn't matter now.

616
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,320
是啊  现在不重要了
No, doesn't matter now.

617
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,310
我认识你很久了  唐德利恩
I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.

618
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,560
没错
Aye.

619
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,450
我想我们第一次见面是在比武大会上
I think the first time we met was at that tournament--

620
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,470
我一直觉得你庸俗乏味
And I always thought you were dull as dirt.

621
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,360
你不坏
You're not bad.

622
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,340
我不讨厌你
I don't hate you.

623
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,520
不喜欢你  但你不坏
Don't like you, but you're not bad.

624
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,100
谢谢你  克里冈
Thank you, Clegane.

625
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,890
真暖心
That warms the heart.

626
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,810
但你没什么特别的
But there's nothing special about you.

627
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,970
你说的没错
You're right about that.

628
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,480
那为什么光之王不停地复活你
So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back?

629
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,160
我见过比你更好的人
I've met better men than you,

630
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,860
他们被吊死在大梁上  或被砍头
and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded,

631
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,110
或在荒郊野外惨兮兮地死掉
or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere.

632
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,000
没一个复活
None of them came back.

633
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,790
你为什么复活
So, why you?

634
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:04,200
你以为我没自问过
You think I don't ask myself that?

635
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,650
无时不刻
Every hour of every day?

636
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,260
我为何还活着
Why am I here?

637
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,430
我该做什么
What am I supposed to do?

638
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,390
光之王看中了我什么
What does the Lord see in me?

639
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,610
然后呢
And?

640
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,800
我不知道
I don't know.

641
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,970
我不理解我们的神
I don't understand our Lord.

642
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,800
你的神
Your Lord.

643
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,820
我不知道祂要我怎样
I don't know what He wants from me.

644
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:32,300
我只知道祂希望我活着
I only know that He wants me alive.

645
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,830
既然他无所不能
If he's so all-powerful,

646
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,940
为什么不直接告诉你到底要怎样
why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?

647
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,780
克里冈
Clegane.

648
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,040
过来
Come over here.

649
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,620
别怕  火又不咬人
Don't worry. The fire won't bite.

650
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,590
我有东西给你看
I want to show you something.

651
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,250
老子掉进崇拜火的人堆里了  真他妈的走运
It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.

652
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,890
是啊
Aye.

653
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,730
苍天有道
Almost seems like divine justice.

654
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,830
哪有什么道  你个蠢蛋
There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt.

655
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,860
要是真有  你早死了
If there was, you'd be dead...

656
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,390
那个丫头还活着
and that girl would be alive.

657
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,400
-你要干什么  -看着火焰
- What do you want? - Look into the flames.

658
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,200
我才不想看什么该死的火焰
I don't want to look in the damn flames.

659
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,360
你把他砍死后  亲眼看见我把他复活
You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down.

660
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,120
不想知道是什么给了我力量吗
Don't you want to know what gave me the power?

661
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,410
我一直在问  就是没人告诉我
I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.

662
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,150
我们没法告诉你
We can't tell you.

663
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,310
只有火焰能告诉你
Only the fire can tell you.

664
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,270
你看到什么
What do you see?

665
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,570
柴火在烧
Logs burning.

666
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,670
继续看
Keep looking.

667
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,580
你看到什么
What do you see?

668
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,240
冰
Ice.

669
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,550
一堵冰墙
A wall of ice.

670
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,480
是绝境长城
The Wall.

671
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,100
还有什么
What else?

672
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,440
长城与大海相接的地方
It's where the Wall meets the sea.

673
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,400
有一座城堡
There's a castle there.

Looks like an arrowhead.

死人在行军
The dead are marching past.

677
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,160
成千上万
Thousands of them.

678
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,460
现在相信我了吗  克里冈
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

679
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,750
相信我们是背负使命而来了吗
Do you believe we're here for a reason?

680
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,490
你他妈的在干什么  克里冈
What the hell are you doing, Clegane?

681
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,790
埋葬死者
Burying the dead.

682
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,760
你认识这些人
You knew these people.

683
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,870
算不上
Not really.

684
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,410
天父  请仁慈地评断我等
We ask the Father to judge us with mercy.

685
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,960
圣母  请...
We ask the Mother to...

686
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,360
见鬼  剩下的不记得了
Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.

687
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,090
你们死了我很遗憾
I'm sorry you're dead.

688
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,350
你们不该如此丧命
You deserved better.

689
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,060
两个都是
Both of you.

690
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,580
妈
Mom.

691
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,830
你真的该睡了  山姆
You should really sleep, Sam.

692
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,330
死人可不睡
The dead don't.

695
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,680

696
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,950
这是什么
What is it?

00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,870
这是龙晶吗
That's dragonglass?

A mountain of it.
